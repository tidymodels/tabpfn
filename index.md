# tabpfn

tabpfn, meaning prior fitted networks for tabular data, is a
deep-learning model. See:

- [*Transformers Can Do Bayesian
  Inference*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10510) (arXiv, 2021)
- [*TabPFN: A Transformer That Solves Small Tabular Classification
  Problems in a Second*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01848) (arXiv, 2022)
- [*Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation
  model*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C7&q=%22Accurate+predictions+on+small+data+with+a+tabular+foundation+model%22)
  (Nature, 2025)

This R package is a wrapper of the [Python
library](https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn) via reticulate. It has an
idiomatic R syntax using standard S3 methods.

## Installation

You can download the package from CRAN via:

``` r

install.packages("tabpfn")
```

or you can install the development version of tabpfn like so:

``` r

require(pak)
pak(c("tidymodels/tabpfn"), ask = FALSE)
```

You’ll need a Python virtual environment to access the underlying
library. After installing the R package, tabpfn will install the
required Python bits when you first fit a model:

``` R
> library(tabpfn)
>
> predictors <- mtcars[, -1]
> outcome <- mtcars[, 1]
>
> # XY interface
> mod <- tab_pfn(predictors, outcome)

## Example

After loading the package:

``` r

library(tabpfn)
```

we can fit a model via the standard x/y interface.

``` r

set.seed(364)
reg_mod <- tab_pfn(mtcars[1:25, -1], mtcars$mpg[1:25])
reg_mod
#> TabPFN Regression Model
#> Training set
#> ℹ 25 data points
#> ℹ 10 predictors
```

There are also formula and recipes interfaces.

Prediction follows the usual S3
[`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html) method:

``` r

predict(reg_mod, mtcars[26:32, -1])
#> # A tibble: 7 × 1
#>   .pred
#>   <dbl>
#> 1  31.4
#> 2  24.3
#> 3  24.8
#> 4  16.4
#> 5  18.9
#> 6  14.4
#> 7  22.5
```

tabpfn follows the tidymodels prediction convention: a data frame is
always returned with a standard set of column names.

For a classification model, the outcome should always be a factor
vector. For example, using these data from the modeldata package:

``` r

library(modeldata)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'modeldata'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:datasets':
#> 
#>     penguins
library(ggplot2)

two_cls_train <- parabolic[1:400,  ]
two_cls_val   <- parabolic[401:500,]
grid <- expand.grid(X1 = seq(-5.1, 5.0, length.out = 25), 
                    X2 = seq(-5.5, 4.0, length.out = 25))

set.seed(3824)
cls_mod <- tab_pfn(class ~ ., data = two_cls_train)

grid_pred <- predict(cls_mod, grid)
grid_pred
#> # A tibble: 625 × 3
#>    .pred_Class1 .pred_Class2 .pred_class
#>           <dbl>        <dbl> <fct>      
#>  1        0.997      0.00273 Class1     
#>  2        0.998      0.00217 Class1     
#>  3        0.998      0.00182 Class1     
#>  4        0.998      0.00155 Class1     
#>  5        0.998      0.00167 Class1     
#>  6        0.998      0.00222 Class1     
#>  7        0.996      0.00438 Class1     
#>  8        0.989      0.0109  Class1     
#>  9        0.948      0.0522  Class1     
#> 10        0.745      0.255   Class1     
#> # ℹ 615 more rows
```

The fit looks fairly good when shown with out-of-sample data:

``` r

cbind(grid, grid_pred) |>
  ggplot(aes(X1, X2)) +
  geom_point(
    data = two_cls_val,
    aes(col = class, pch = class),
    alpha = 3 / 4,
    cex = 3
  ) +
  geom_contour(
    aes(z = .pred_Class1),
    breaks = 1 / 2,
    col = "black",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  coord_equal(ratio = 1)
```

## License

[PriorLabs](https://priorlabs.ai/) created the model. Starting with
version 2.5, using TabPFN requires accepting the model license and
setting a token. Each model version (v2.5, v2.6, etc.) has its own
license that must be accepted individually.

To get access, visit <https://ux.priorlabs.ai>, go to the **Licenses**
tab (1), and accept the license for each model version you intend to use
(2). Then set the `TABPFN_TOKEN` environment variable with the token
from your account. Users who already have `TABPFN_TOKEN` set can use
TabPFN v2 without any additional steps.

Also, the model is most effective when a GPU is available (by an order
of magnitude or two). This may seem obvious to anyone already working
with deep learning models, but it is a fairly new requirement for those
strictly working with traditional tabular data models.
